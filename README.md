# BubbleSortMusic
Making music with Bubble Sort algorithm using Sonic Pi.

In Bubble Sort algorithm you go through an unsorted list of elements and compare each element with the one directly next in the list. If that element is smaller than the current element, swap them. I set a boolean that keeps track of whether or not a swap has occurred and an integer for how many iterations we've been through and we play music by them (a flip sound whenever a swap happens and starting the music with iteration number and as it grows its amplitude grows with it.) I also play every element in the unsorted array in the beginning and every element in the sorted array in the end(4 times).There's also a back ground music playing when we enter the loop and a sound showing whenever we enter the loop. In the sorting process the element that we are comparing to the next one plays a sound and the element it's being compared to. At the end a sound plays that shows the sorting process is done.
